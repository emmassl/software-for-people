      <p>In 1972, Trout lived in a basement apartment in Cohoes, New York. He made his living as 
        an installer of aluminum combination storm windows and screens. He had nothing to do with 
        the sales end of the businessâ€”because he had no charm. Charm was a scheme for making strangers 
        like and trust a person immediately, no matter what the charmer had in mind.</p>
      
      <p class="indented">Dwayne Hoover had oodles of charm.</p>

      <p class="indented">I can have oodles of charm when I want to.</p>

      <p class="indented">A lot of people have oodles of charm.</p>

      <p>Trout's employer and co-workers had no idea that he was a writer. No reputable publisher 
        had ever heard of him, for that matter, even though he had written one hundred and seventeen 
        novels and two thousand short stories by the time he met Dwayne.</p>

      <p>He made carbon copies of nothing he wrote. He mailed off manuscripts without enclosing stamped, 
        self-addressed envelopes for their safe return. Sometimes he didn't even include a return address. 
        He got names and addresses of publishers from magazines devoted to the writing business, 
        which he read avidly in the periodical rooms of public libraries. He thus got in touch with 
        a firm called World Classics Library, which published hard-core pornography in Los Angeles, California. 
        They used his stories, which usually didn't even have women in them, to give bulk to books and magazines 
        of salacious pictures.</p>

      <p>They never told him where or when he might expect to find himself in print. 
        Here is what they paid him: doodleysquat.</p>

      <p>They didn't even send him complimentary copies of the books and magazines in which he appeared, 
        so he had to search them out in pornography stores. And the titles he gave to his stories were often changed. 
        "Pan Galactic Straw-boss," for instance, became "Mouth Crazy."</p>

      <p>Most distracting to Trout, however, were the illustrations his publishers selected, which had 
        nothing to do with his tales. He wrote a novel, for instance, about an Earthling named Delmore Skag, 
        a bachelor in a neighborhood where everybody else had enormous families. And Skag was a scientist, 
        and he found a way to reproduce himself in chicken soup. He would shave living cells from the palm of 
        his right hand, mix them with the soup, and expose the soup to cosmic rays. The cells turned into 
        babies which looked exactly like Delmore Skag.</p>

      <p>Pretty soon, Delmore was having several babies a day, and inviting his neighbors to share 
        his pride and happiness. He had mass baptisms of as many as a hundred babies at a time. 
        He became famous as a family man.</p>

      <p>And so on.</p>
