    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Emma Slagle, and I'm from O'ahu, Hawai'i. I'm a current junior at Yale University
        studying Computing and the Arts (CS + Design), along with an Advanced German Language Certificate. 
    </p>
    <p>This site is a product of my ART 369 course, Software for People: Interactive Design and the Internet.
        Our first project challenged us to think of a website as something more than a digital platform—a vessel. 
        A vessel for information and a holder for collections. We were tasked with creating a digital collection 
        of at least 15 entries, each reflecting something personally meaningful. The guiding question was not 
        just what we would collect, but why: why does this collection deserve to exist, and what does it reveal 
        about us?
        For me, the concept that resonated most was the idea of creating a collection that could serve 
        as an authentic reflection of myself—a collection of my own works. I didn't want this site as just an archive 
        of my work though—I wanted it to serve as a narrative that offers brief insight into my process, 
        my influences, and the artistic values that shape me.  
        Creating this collection gave me the chance to revisit works I hadn’t looked at in months or even years, 
        reconnecting with the inspirations and feelings that originally led me to create them. As viewers
        navigate through the collection, they can engage with my work intimately, exploring 
        connections and interpretations that bring their own perspectives to each piece. The design choices 
        and interactive features encourage this kind of reflection, helping to bridge the gap between artist 
        and audience and turning creativity into something shared and experienced together.
        In this way, my collection becomes a vessel not only for my work but also for the conversations 
        and connections it inspires. </p>
        <p>Feel free to mosy around. Some pages have more content than others. It is always a work in progress.
            The style of each page was inspired by Enzo Mari's site. </p>
