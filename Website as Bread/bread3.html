    <p>The creation process of bread, involing cycles of kneading and baking, is also 
        comparable to the development process of a website. Both bread and websites start
    with their raw ideas and ingredients mixed together, but only through iterative "kneading" 
and refinement (testing, debugging, and user feedback) are we presented with our polished final product.</p>
