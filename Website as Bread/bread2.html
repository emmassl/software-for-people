    <p>Yeast in bread acts as a catalyst for growth, allowing ingredients to rise
        and form something larger than their initial form. Simiarly, connections between
        websites, like servers, databases, and APIs, allow websites to become dynamic
        and enable user interactions. Without these connections, websites, like unrisen dough,
        can seem lifeless.
